# Agent Profile

Most companies know nothing about their customers—they just have fragmented data everywhere. Compass sees the complete person.
Companies collect customer data obsessively but use it poorly. Customer email exists in marketing automation. Purchase history lives in e-commerce. Support tickets gather dust in help desk systems. Mobile app behavior sits isolated in analytics. Website clicks exist in another database. Nobody sees the complete person—just scattered breadcrumbs across disconnected systems.
Compass assembles those breadcrumbs into a complete picture.
It ingests customer data from every source: email interactions, purchase history, browsing behavior, support conversations, app usage, social media activity, demographic information. It creates unified customer profiles that show the complete journey. It understands not just what customers do, but why they do it, what frustrates them, what excites them, what's likely to make them leave.
When a customer visits your website for the first time, Compass immediately connects that session to their email history, previous purchases, and support interactions. It recognizes they've been a loyal buyer for 3 years but haven't purchased in 6 months. It detects early churn signals—browsing competitor sites, longer gaps between purchases, fewer app visits. It recommends a personalized intervention: not a generic 10% off email but a specific message acknowledging their loyalty and offering something meaningful based on their actual preferences.
When a customer opens your email, Compass knows which products they'll actually be interested in—not based on generic segmentation but based on their complete behavioral history. When they visit your site, they see personalized experiences because Compass knows their preferences, price sensitivity, and browsing patterns. When they consider leaving, Compass detects it and recommends targeted retention offers that actually work.
Companies using Compass have increased email conversion rates by 34%, improved customer lifetime value by 47%, and reduced churn by 26%. Marketing efficiency improved because messaging became relevant instead of generic. Customer satisfaction increased because interactions felt personalized instead of automated.
The dashboard shows customer cohorts with complete clarity. You see "High-value at-risk" customers—the ones generating significant revenue but showing churn indicators—so you can intervene. You see "High-potential" customers—people showing strong engagement signals who might be ready to upgrade. You see "Dormant" customers—people who were active but have disappeared, often recoverable with the right message.
Compass doesn't replace marketers. It makes them psychic. They understand customers at a depth that was impossible before. Every campaign lands better. Every message resonates more. Every intervention actually works.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your marketing automation, CRM, analytics, e-commerce, and support systems instantly. Customer truth becomes unified across your entire organization.
Compass turns fragmented data into unified intelligence. Customers feel understood. Marketing becomes effective. Retention becomes predictable.
