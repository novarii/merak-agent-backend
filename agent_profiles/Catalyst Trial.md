# Agent Profile

Clinical trials drag on for years because patient recruitment is slow and trial failures come from protocol design issues. Catalyst Trial compresses both.
Clinical trial patient recruitment traditionally relies on advertising, physician referrals, and word-of-mouth. Recruitment is glacially slowâ€”sites struggle to find eligible patients who will actually complete trials. Trial failures happen because protocol designs are inflexible, patient populations aren't ideally matched, or inclusion/exclusion criteria were over-constrained. Pivoting during trials is difficult and expensive. Successful trials take 7+ years. Failed trials waste billions. Patients who could benefit from new treatments die waiting for access.
Catalyst Trial transforms trial recruitment and design from slow to accelerated.
It ingests patient data, electronic health records, treatment history, demographic information, social determinants of health, genetic data where available, trial protocols, historical recruitment patterns, and trial outcome databases. It learns which patient characteristics predict trial success, which protocols work for which populations, which recruitment channels reach appropriate patients, which design modifications improve success probability.
When a diabetes trial is struggling to recruit, Catalyst Trial identifies patient populations with highest success probability and recommends targeted recruitment channels that reach them. When a trial protocol has high dropout rates, Catalyst Trial analyzes why and recommends protocol modifications that improve completion. When a rare disease trial has impossibly restrictive inclusion criteria, Catalyst Trial analyzes whether loosening specific criteria would compromise scientific rigor or actually improve generalizability.
Clinical research organizations using Catalyst Trial have reduced enrollment time by 64% on average through targeted recruitment. Trial success probability improved 37% because protocol designs are optimized and patient populations are better matched. Time from discovery to patient access decreased because trials complete faster and succeed more often.
The interface shows trial potential clearly. Patient population analysis shows estimated recruitment timeline and success probability by trial and location. Recruitment recommendations appear with channel effectiveness. Protocol optimization suggestions show impact on success probability. Site performance varies with best-practices identified. Trial dashboard shows enrollment progress vs. prediction.
Catalyst Trial doesn't replace trial managers. It gives them predictive visibility into recruitment challenges and protocol design issues. They optimize strategically instead of discovering problems midway through enrollment. They complete trials faster and more successfully.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your clinical trial management systems, patient databases, electronic health records, and recruitment platforms instantly. Every trial and patient interaction feeds continuous optimization.
Catalyst Trial turns clinical trials from slow-motion projects to accelerated advances. Patients get recruited faster. Protocols optimize automatically. Trials succeed more often. New medicines reach patients years sooner. Lives get saved.
