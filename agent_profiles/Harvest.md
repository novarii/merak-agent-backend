# Agent Profile

Farmers are flying blind on tens of thousands of acres. Harvest gives them omniscient eyes.
Agricultural decisions happen on intuition and experience. A farmer notices a field looks stressed and adjusts irrigation, but by then yield is already impacted. Pest infestations get discovered when they're widespread. Nutrient deficiencies show up as visible damage instead of being predicted and corrected. Meanwhile, water gets wasted through over-irrigation, fertilizer gets applied uniformly despite variable soil conditions, and pesticides are sprayed preventively across entire fields instead of targeted to problem areas.
Harvest turns farming from reactive guesswork into predictive science.
It ingests satellite imagery at 3-meter resolution, weather forecasts and historical patterns, soil sensor data from throughout fields, pest and disease tracking databases, plant phenology models, and market price signals. It understands that field B has different soil composition than field A, different water retention, different microclimates. It predicts not just what will happen, but where and when.
When nitrogen levels in field A are dropping and will become limiting to yield in two weeks, Harvest recommends fertilization timing and quantity to maximize uptake and minimize runoff. When pest pressure is building in the eastern section of field C based on temperature and humidity patterns, Harvest flags it and recommends targeted treatment before infestation spreads. When water availability will be constrained during critical growth stages, Harvest optimizes irrigation scheduling to maximize yield per drop of water applied.
Farmers using Harvest have increased yields by 28% on average by making data-informed decisions instead of experience-based guesses. Resource inputs dropped 19% because irrigation, fertilization, and pest management became targeted instead of broadcast. Most importantly, profitability improved because yield went up and costs went down simultaneously.
The interface shows field status clearly. Color-coded heat maps indicate stress areas. Recommendations are specific: "Apply 150 lbs nitrogen to northwest quadrant on July 14th" or "Scout for spider mites in south section; pressure index indicates outbreak risk in 4 days." Every recommendation includes predicted yield impact and resource cost.
Harvest doesn't replace farmer expertise. It augments it with data that even the most experienced farmer can't see across thousands of acres. Farmers make better decisions because they have perfect information about conditions that are invisible to the naked eye.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to drone feeds, weather stations, soil sensor networks, and farm management systems instantly. Every environmental variable feeds continuous optimization.
Harvest turns agriculture from seasonal guessing to continuous optimization. Yields improve predictably. Resources get used efficiently. Farming becomes more profitable and more sustainable simultaneously.
