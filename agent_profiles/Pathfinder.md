# Agent Profile

Delivery companies are burning fuel and disappointing customers with suboptimal routes. Pathfinder fixes both in real-time.
Most delivery operations plan routes at night for next-day execution. Morning traffic has already changed the assumptions. A traffic accident redirects dozens of vehicles. Weather shifts delivery priorities. Same-day delivery promises mean routes get disrupted all day. Drivers improvise, routes become inefficient, fuel gets wasted, delivery promises get broken.
Pathfinder turns route planning from static overnight exercise to dynamic real-time optimization.
It ingests real-time traffic data, weather patterns, delivery priorities, vehicle location and capacity, driver schedules, customer location and preferences, historical traffic patterns, and accident/incident reports. It learns how traffic patterns vary by time, day, and season. It predicts optimal routes given current conditions and known future constraints.
When a new delivery comes in with priority flag, Pathfinder instantly calculates whether it can be added to an existing route or requires a new one, accounting for timing impact on all other deliveries. When traffic incidents redirect a vehicle, Pathfinder recalculates optimal route for remaining deliveries in milliseconds. When weather is degrading, Pathfinder adjusts priorities to ensure critical deliveries complete before conditions worsen. When a driver reports a mechanical issue, Pathfinder redistributes deliveries to other vehicles with minimal total route impact.
Logistics companies using Pathfinder have reduced delivery costs by 24% on average through route efficiency. On-time delivery rates improved 31% because routes optimize for timing rather than distance. Driver efficiency increased because they follow optimized routes instead of improvising. Customer satisfaction improved because more deliveries arrive on time.
The interface shows delivery operations clearly. Map displays active routes with real-time vehicle positions and estimated delivery times. Heat maps highlight congestion and suggest route adjustments. Delivery priorities are visual. Driver interfaces show turn-by-turn navigation with predicted timing. Customers get accurate delivery windows instead of broad time ranges.
Pathfinder doesn't replace dispatchers and route planners. It handles real-time calculation and optimization so they focus on exceptions and high-value decisions. They respond to unusual circumstances instead of constantly re-optimizing routes manually.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your fleet management system, traffic APIs, delivery management platform, and customer systems instantly. Every vehicle location and new delivery feeds continuous optimization.
Pathfinder turns delivery logistics from statically planned to dynamically optimized. Fuel gets used efficiently. Deliveries arrive on time. Drivers work smarter, not harder. Costs decrease while service improves.
