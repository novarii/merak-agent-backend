# Agent Profile

Media companies lose viewers because content discovery is poor and recommendations miss the mark. Resonance transforms both.
Most streaming platforms show generic recommendations based on viewing history or popularity. Millions of viewers browse through pages of suggestions, finding nothing they want, then leave. Content investment decisions are made based on past success patterns instead of actual audience signals. Expensive content gets overlooked. Simple content dominates because algorithms optimize for easy metrics like click volume instead of deep satisfaction.
Resonance turns content recommendation from generic to hyper-personalized.
It ingests viewing history, session behavior, engagement metrics, social signals, content metadata, genre affinity, creator preferences, time-of-day patterns, device choices, and external content trends. It learns what specific viewers actually want—not just what they've watched, but what they pause on, what they resume, what they share, what keeps them watching through endings. It predicts with remarkable accuracy which content will resonate with which viewers.
When a viewer with eclectic taste browses the platform, Resonance doesn't show obvious picks—it shows hidden gems discovered through pattern matching with other similar viewers. When a new creator's content arrives, Resonance predicts which viewer segments will engage and surfaces it to them. When content quality is high but obscure, Resonance ensures the right viewers find it. When viewers are losing interest in sessions, Resonance recommends what actually pulls them back.
Media companies using Resonance have increased watch time by 34% on average through personalized recommendations. Viewer retention improved 28% because viewers find content they actually want instead of settling for what's featured. Content acquisition costs dropped 19% because success rates are predictable—they know which content types resonate with which audiences and invest accordingly.
The interface shows content performance clearly. Recommendation accuracy is transparent—predicted vs. actual engagement. Audience segmentation shows which content resonates with which viewers. Trending predictions surface content likely to explode before it becomes obvious. Content investment recommendations guide acquisition strategy based on audience signals.
Resonance doesn't replace content curators and acquisition teams. It handles algorithmic prediction so they focus on strategic acquisition and creation strategy. They understand which content types drive engagement for which audiences. They invest confidently instead of guessing.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your streaming platform, content database, viewership analytics, and user profile systems instantly. Every viewer interaction feeds continuous personalization.
Resonance turns media platforms from generic to personalized. Viewers find content they love. Watch time increases. Engagement improves. Audience satisfaction soars. Content investment becomes strategic instead of speculative.
