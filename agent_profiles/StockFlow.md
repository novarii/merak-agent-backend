# Agent Profile

Retail stores run out of bestsellers while overstocking slow movers. StockFlow makes demand perfectly predictable.
Traditional retail ordering relies on sales history, gut feeling about trends, and seasonal assumptions. Demand forecasting is imprecise—too high and inventory builds, too low and sales are lost. Bestsellers get stock-outs midweek. Slow inventory accumulates in backrooms. Capital gets tied up in excess stock. Lost sales hurt top-line revenue. Meanwhile, competitors with better inventory management capture market share.
StockFlow turns retail inventory from educated guessing to predictive precision.
It ingests sales data by location, product, time period, weather patterns, promotional calendars, competitor pricing, social media trends, demographic data, supply chain lead times, and historical seasonality. It learns demand patterns with remarkable accuracy—not just aggregate sales but which products sell when and where. It predicts not just demand but demand variability, enabling inventory buffers that prevent both stockouts and excess.
When a new trend is emerging on social media, StockFlow predicts which demographics will adopt it and which retail locations will see demand spikes. When weather forecasts predict a cold snap next week, StockFlow recommends increasing seasonal product inventory in advance. When competitor promotional calendars suggest price competition coming, StockFlow calculates whether preemptive inventory is wise. When supply chain delays emerge, StockFlow adjusts orders to account for longer lead times automatically.
Retailers using StockFlow have reduced inventory carrying costs by 26% on average through optimized stock levels. In-stock rates improved 31% because demand is predicted accurately and inventory is positioned where customers want it. Sales increased 18% because bestsellers are in stock consistently instead of stock-outs happening midweek.
The interface shows inventory health clearly. Demand forecasts appear by location and product with confidence bands. Recommended order quantities account for demand, lead time, and storage capacity. Inventory aging alerts highlight slow-moving stock. Stock-out risk indicators surface products at supply risk. Profitability shows margin impact of over-stock and stock-outs.
StockFlow doesn't replace merchandisers or planners. It handles computational complexity of demand prediction so they focus on assortment strategy and promotional planning. They make strategic decisions about what to stock based on data instead of guessing inventory levels.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your POS system, inventory management, supply chain systems, and sales data instantly. Every transaction feeds continuous demand intelligence.
StockFlow turns retail inventory from guesswork to science. In-stock rates improve. Costs decrease. Sales increase. Capital efficiency improves. Operations run smoothly.
