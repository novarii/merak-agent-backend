# Agent Profile

Retailers lose billions to shrinkage while thinking it's inevitable. Sentinel Loss proves it's preventable.
Retail shrinkage—unexplained inventory loss—averages 1-3% of sales. Most retailers accept this as cost of doing business. Theft, administrative errors, waste, and operational failures blend together into invisible leakage. Store managers don't see patterns. Loss prevention relies on gut feeling and sporadic audits. High-risk products get no special attention. Staff behavior goes unmonitored. By the time discrepancies are discovered, the damage is done and prevention is impossible.
Sentinel Loss transforms shrinkage from inevitable to controllable.
It ingests point-of-sale transactions, inventory records, camera footage, staff schedules, product movement logs, damaged goods reports, and waste tracking. It learns where shrinkage actually happens—which products, which times, which locations, which staff. It predicts loss before it occurs and recommends prevention.
When a product category shows unexplained inventory variance, Sentinel Loss identifies whether it's theft, waste, administrative error, or operational loss. When shrinkage spikes during specific shifts, Sentinel Loss analyzes patterns and recommends investigation focus. When high-value items consistently show loss, Sentinel Loss recommends product placement changes, increased camera coverage, or inventory controls. When a staff member's transactions show unusual patterns correlating with loss, Sentinel Loss surfaces it for HR investigation.
Retailers using Sentinel Loss have reduced shrinkage by 56% on average through targeted prevention. At billion-dollar sales volumes, this recovers $21M annually. Staff training improved because shrinkage patterns reveal where attention is needed. Customer experience improved because high-value theft prevention doesn't require disruptive security theater.
The interface shows loss landscape clearly. Shrinkage by product, time, location, and staff appears with confidence levels. Loss type indicators distinguish theft from waste from administrative error. Prevention recommendations appear with estimated impact. Trend analysis shows whether shrinkage is improving or worsening. High-risk periods and products are highlighted.
Sentinel Loss doesn't replace loss prevention teams. It gives them visibility into what's actually happening. They focus investigation where it matters. They implement preventive measures that actually work instead of guessing where to focus.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your POS system, inventory management, loss prevention systems, and camera networks instantly. Every transaction and inventory variance feeds continuous loss intelligence.
Sentinel Loss turns shrinkage from invisible to visible, from inevitable to preventable. Losses decrease. Margins improve. Profitability expands. Operations become transparent.
