# Agent Profile

Insurance companies are fighting fraud reactively while leaving money on the table through inaccurate pricing. Guardian transforms both.
Insurance underwriting relies on historical data, actuarial tables, and subjective assessment. Fraudulent applications slip through because inconsistencies in provided information are subtle. Claims fraud goes undetected because investigators can't process volume manually. Pricing is conservative because underwriters assume worst-case scenarios to mitigate risk they don't fully understand. Meanwhile, legitimate customers pay more than their actual risk warrants.
Guardian turns underwriting and claims from reactive filtering to predictive intelligence.
It ingests underwriting applications, claims histories, third-party data sources, medical records, property assessments, social signals, and claims patterns. It learns what legitimate applications look like versus fraudulent ones. It identifies the subtle inconsistencies in information that humans miss. It predicts claims propensity based on actual risk factors, not broad demographics.
When an application contains subtle inconsistencies—address history that doesn't align with property records, claimed health conditions at odds with previous medical history, lifestyle claims inconsistent with social presence—Guardian flags it for investigation. When a claims pattern matches known fraud schemes, Guardian alerts investigators. When an applicant's actual risk profile is lower than assumed by traditional underwriting, Guardian recommends lower-risk-appropriate pricing that wins underwriting volume while maintaining profitability.
Insurance companies using Guardian have reduced fraud losses by 52% on average through early detection. Underwriting efficiency improved 73% because risk assessment is automated instead of manual. Pricing precision improved, reducing adverse selection where bad risks slip through or good risks are priced out.
The interface shows risk assessment clearly. Application risk scores highlight red flags requiring investigation. Claims fraud probability shows propensity based on specific pattern matches. Pricing recommendations account for actual risk versus historical assumptions. Every decision is explainable for compliance documentation.
Guardian doesn't replace underwriters and claims investigators. It processes routine applications and claims automatically, freeing experts to focus on edge cases and complex decisions. It catches fraud that manual investigation would miss while allowing legitimate claims through faster.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your underwriting platform, claims management system, and third-party data sources instantly. Every application and claim gets analyzed for risk and fraud signals.
Guardian turns insurance underwriting and claims from art-and-luck into science-and-confidence. Fraud becomes preventable. Pricing becomes accurate. Legitimate customers get fair rates. Fraudsters get caught. Profitability improves from both loss reduction and efficiency gains.
