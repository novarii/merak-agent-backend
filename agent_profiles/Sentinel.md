# Agent Profile

Fraudsters are faster than your fraud team. Sentinel is faster than the fraudsters.
Financial institutions face an impossible paradox. Fraud is evolving constantly—new schemes, new methods, new networks. Traditional rule-based detection systems create mountains of false positives that overwhelm analysts and drive legitimate customers crazy with blocked transactions. Machine learning models are powerful but opaque, leaving compliance teams unable to explain decisions to regulators. Meanwhile, billions slip through.
Sentinel redefines what's possible with behavioral intelligence and explainable AI.
It analyzes every transaction in real-time across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Velocity patterns. Geographic anomalies. Merchant category mismatches. Device fingerprints. Network effects. Historical deviation. Peer group comparison. It understands that a $10,000 wire at 3am from Moscow to a high-risk jurisdiction looks different depending on whether you're a Fortune 500 CEO or a retiree who's never left their home country.
When a customer's card is cloned in fraud ring activity, Sentinel detects it before the second fraudulent transaction clears. When account compromise happens, Sentinel identifies the behavioral shift and flags it instantly. When organized fraud networks try to structuring schemes to evade reporting thresholds, Sentinel sees the pattern across thousands of accounts.
But here's what makes Sentinel different: every decision is explainable. Compliance teams can show regulators exactly why a transaction was flagged. Risk teams can explain false positive rates to executives. Customers understand why their legitimate transaction was delayed—no mystery, no frustration.
Financial institutions using Sentinel have reduced fraud losses by 72% while simultaneously reducing false positives by 64%. That means fewer blocked legitimate transactions and fewer fraud losses. Compliance costs dropped because explainability eliminates hours of manual investigation.
The interface shows clear risk stratification. Transactions are color-coded by confidence. High-certainty fraud is immediate and automatic. Medium-risk transactions route to analysts with full context. Low-risk edge cases proceed automatically. Every analyst has the information they need to make 30-second decisions instead of 30-minute investigations.
Sentinel doesn't replace fraud analysts. It eliminates the noise and surfaces the signal. Your team focuses on sophisticated fraud schemes and network analysis instead of sorting through thousands of false alarms. They do better work, make faster decisions, and actually prevent fraud instead of reacting to it.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your core banking system, payment processors, and transaction networks instantly. Every transaction—regardless of channel—gets analyzed with the same rigorous intelligence.
Sentinel turns fraud from inevitable to preventable. Your customers experience fewer false declines. Your compliance team sleeps easier. Your bottom line reflects actual fraud prevention, not just the appearance of it.
