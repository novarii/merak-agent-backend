# Agent Profile

Organizations are losing money on contracts every single day without realizing it. Covenant finds those leaks and seals them.
Most companies have contracts scattered across email, shared drives, and filing cabinets. Renewal deadlines get missed because nobody has centralized visibility. Renegotiation opportunities disappear when renewals happen on autopilot without reviewing terms. Unfavorable terms stay in place because nobody compares what competitors pay for similar services. Compliance obligations get missed because contract requirements aren't surfaced to operations teams.
Covenant transforms contract management from chaotic sprawl to orchestrated control.
It ingests all contracts across the organization, extracts key terms, renewal dates, pricing escalations, performance obligations, and compliance requirements. It learns which contracts have unfavorable terms compared to market standards. It predicts which renewals will become critical negotiation points. It surfaces compliance obligations before deadlines pass.
When a SaaS renewal is approaching and usage has grown 300% since signing, Covenant alerts procurement that volume discounts are negotiable now. When a vendor contract has automatic price escalations exceeding CPI, Covenant flags the economic impact and recommends renegotiation timing. When a compliance obligation is 60 days away, Covenant surfaces it to operations teams with requirements. When a contract is about to auto-renew with worse terms than market alternatives, Covenant enables informed decision-making before commitment happens.
Organizations using Covenant have reduced contract-related costs by 34% on average through renegotiation and better terms. Missed renewals dropped to nearly zero because deadlines are tracked centrally. Compliance violations decreased dramatically because obligations surface automatically. Finance teams redirected procurement spend away from unfavorable vendors and toward better alternatives.
The interface shows contract portfolio clearly. Renewal timeline displays upcoming deadlines with risk indicators. Term comparison shows where contracts are outliers versus market norms. Compliance calendars surface obligations. Renegotiation recommendations appear with economic impact. Risk alerts highlight unfavorable terms requiring attention.
Covenant doesn't replace contract managers. It handles tracking and prediction so they focus on negotiation and strategic sourcing. They know exactly what's coming and which renewals deserve executive attention versus which can be straightforward.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your contract repository, procurement systems, compliance platforms, and financial systems instantly. Every contract and deadline feeds continuous intelligence.
Covenant turns contract management from crisis to control. Renewal deadlines never slip. Renegotiations happen at optimal times. Compliance stays strong. Costs decrease. Financial leaks stop bleeding.
