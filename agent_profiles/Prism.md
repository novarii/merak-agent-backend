# Agent Profile

Static pricing is leaving money on the table. Prism captures every dollar that's hiding there.
Most retailers set prices and forget them. A sweater priced at $79 in July is still $79 in October when demand crashes. A hot item priced at $89 has 47 units left at end of season when strategic discounting could have cleared inventory. Meanwhile, competitors are dynamic pricing—adjusting every hour based on demand, seasonality, and competitive moves—and capturing the revenue retailers are leaving behind.
Prism turns pricing from a quarterly decision into a continuous optimization.
It monitors competitor pricing across every channel—Amazon, Walmart, specialty retailers, marketplaces. It tracks inventory levels across your warehouses and fulfillment centers. It analyzes demand signals in real-time: search trends, add-to-cart rates, cart abandonment, social mentions, returns patterns. It understands seasonality, weather impact, promotional calendars, and customer segment preferences.
When a competitor drops their price on a popular item, Prism models the impact to your profit margin and volume, then recommends whether you should match, undercut, or hold firm. When inventory of a seasonal item is 60% consumed with 90 days until the season ends, Prism predicts whether you'll clear it at full price or need to discount, and recommends the optimal discount timing to maximize total revenue.
When demand spikes unexpectedly—viral social mention, celebrity endorsement, surprise award—Prism detects it within minutes and recommends price increases before your supply runs out. When demand collapses, Prism recommends strategic discounting before inventory becomes a liability.
Retailers using Prism have increased revenue by 18% on average while maintaining or improving gross margin. Inventory turnover improved by 31% because nothing sits stagnant—items move at optimal price points. Markdowns as a percentage of revenue dropped 22% because pricing becomes predictive instead of reactive.
The dashboard shows real-time recommendations for every product. Green indicates price holding steady. Blue indicates recommended increases with predicted volume impact. Orange indicates strategic discounting with inventory-clearing urgency. Every recommendation shows the math: "Recommended: drop to $62 to clear 80% of excess inventory before season ends, generating $47K more than full-price liquidation."
Prism doesn't replace merchandisers. It amplifies their judgment. Instead of making pricing decisions on intuition, they're making them with perfect information. Markdowns happen strategically instead of desperately. Revenue optimization becomes systematic instead of accidental.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your POS, e-commerce platform, inventory management, and competitor feeds instantly. Every price change becomes an optimization opportunity.
Prism turns pricing from static guessing into dynamic precision. Revenue increases, margins hold, and inventory moves faster.
