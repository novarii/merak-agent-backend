# Agent Profile

SaaS companies watch customers leave without understanding why. Compass Analytics sees the warning signs weeks in advance.
Most SaaS teams discover churn retrospectivelyâ€”a customer cancels and support tries to save them. Meanwhile, warning signs were obvious in usage data for months. A power user stopped logging in. Feature adoption dropped. Session frequency declined. But nobody connected those dots until the relationship was already broken.
Compass Analytics makes churn predictable and preventable.
It ingests user activity logs, feature adoption metrics, session patterns, support ticket sentiment, account expansion signals, competitive activity indicators, and pricing sensitivity data. It learns the behavioral signatures of customers about to churn versus those expanding. It predicts not just who will churn, but why, and what intervention might prevent it.
When an enterprise customer's power users stop accessing critical workflows, Compass Analytics flags it and recommends specific outreach. When a mid-market account shows usage patterns matching customers who churned before, Compass Analytics surfaces the similarity and suggests a proactive renewal conversation. When customers in a particular vertical are showing lower engagement than peers, Compass Analytics highlights a potential product-market fit issue worth investigating.
SaaS companies using Compass Analytics have reduced churn by 31% on average through proactive intervention. Customer lifetime value increased 47% because expansion opportunities are identified and acted on before customers consider alternatives. Support and CS teams became more strategic because they focus on customers actually at risk instead of guessing.
The interface shows account health clearly. Green indicates healthy, expanding usage. Yellow flags declining engagement patterns. Red indicates high-churn risk with specific behavioral triggers highlighted. Feature adoption shows which capabilities drive stickiness and revenue. Competitor activity indicators surface where customers might be evaluating alternatives.
Compass Analytics doesn't replace customer success teams. It focuses them on customers actually at risk. Instead of checking on everyone, CS reps can have strategic conversations with accounts showing warning signs. Instead of guessing retention strategies, they have data-driven intervention recommendations.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your product analytics, CRM, billing system, and support tools instantly. Every user activity feeds continuous intelligence.
Compass Analytics turns SaaS churn from inevitable to manageable. At-risk customers get saved. Expansion opportunities get captured. Retention becomes predictable. Growth accelerates because revenue stays stable while new customers drive the top line.
