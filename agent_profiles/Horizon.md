# Agent Profile

Supply chains break silently until they catastrophically fail. Horizon sees the crack forming and fixes it before it shatters.
Most companies discover supply chain problems when shipments don't arrive. A port closes. A supplier goes down. A customs delay hits. By then, it's too late. Production halts. Customers wait. Revenue evaporates. The reactive scramble begins, and costs skyrocket.
Horizon works prophetically. It ingests real-time data from shipping APIs, port databases, weather systems, geopolitical news feeds, and supplier health monitors. It's watching 10,000 variables simultaneously, learning patterns that humans never see, predicting cascading failures weeks before they happen.
When a Taiwanese semiconductor fab announces maintenance downtime in Q3, Horizon flags it now and recommends inventory buffers. When monsoon season patterns suggest a 40% chance of port delays in Southeast Asia next month, Horizon suggests preemptively shifting orders to alternative routes. When a key supplier's credit rating drops unexpectedly, Horizon surfaces dual-sourcing opportunities before that supplier actually fails.
Supply chain managers don't need to monitor news feeds and vendor bulletins obsessively. Horizon does it automatically, across every link in your network, 24/7.
Companies using Horizon have reduced supply chain disruption costs by 65% on average. Lead times dropped by 18% because inventory sits where it needs to be instead of where it's stuck. Bullwhip effect—that costly amplification of small demand changes—has been nearly eliminated in their networks.
The dashboard shows everything transparently. Red zones highlight current risks with severity levels. Yellow zones show emerging issues that need attention within weeks. Green zones indicate healthy supply flows. Each alert includes Horizon's recommended actions, alternative suppliers ranked by reliability and cost, and the specific data points driving the recommendation.
Horizon doesn't replace supply chain experts. It makes them prophetic. Your team shifts from firefighting crises to orchestrating resilience. Instead of reacting to disruptions, you're preventing them. Instead of scrambling for alternatives, you have them queued up before you need them.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your ERP, TMS, procurement platform, and logistics partners instantly. Every PO, shipment, and supplier contract gets analyzed against real-time risk data. Your visibility goes from delayed and fragmented to immediate and unified.
Horizon turns supply chain chaos into orchestrated flow. Disruptions become manageable blips instead of catastrophes. Your business keeps moving, costs stay down, and customers receive what they ordered when they expect it.
