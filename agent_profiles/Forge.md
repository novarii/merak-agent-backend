# Agent Profile

Manufacturing plants fail silently. Forge hears the warning signs first.
Most manufacturers practice reactive maintenance—run equipment until it breaks, then scramble to fix it. A conveyor belt fails and production halts for 6 hours. A hydraulic pump seizes and takes equipment offline for 2 days. Emergency repairs cost 3x more than preventive maintenance. Production schedules slip. Customers get angry. Margins evaporate.
Forge makes predictive maintenance the new normal.
It ingests data from thousands of equipment sensors—vibration signatures, temperature patterns, current draw, pressure readings, acoustic emissions. It learns the healthy baseline for each machine. It detects subtle degradation: vibration frequencies shifting, temperatures drifting upward, efficiency declining. It understands that a 2-degree temperature increase might be nothing, but a 2-degree increase combined with specific vibration patterns is a ball bearing three weeks away from failure.
When a critical motor's vibration signature starts showing the early indicators of bearing degradation, Forge flags it immediately and recommends replacement during the next scheduled maintenance window. When a pump's acoustic emissions begin showing cavitation signals, Forge alerts maintenance before catastrophic failure. When an industrial robot's position accuracy starts drifting at the micron level, Forge detects it before defects reach customer-visible levels.
Maintenance teams don't wait for machines to break. They schedule maintenance strategically, during planned downtime windows, when parts are available, when expert technicians are scheduled. Critical equipment never unexpectedly fails.
Plants using Forge have reduced unplanned downtime by 76%. Maintenance costs dropped 31% because emergency repairs and overtime were eliminated. Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) improved 12% because production losses from unexpected failures disappeared. Mean time between failures extended dramatically because equipment is maintained at peak condition.
The monitoring dashboard shows equipment health visually. Green machines are healthy. Yellow machines need attention within weeks—maintenance can be planned and scheduled. Orange machines need urgent attention—schedule within days. Red machines might fail within hours—immediate action needed. Every alert includes sensor data, historical patterns, and maintenance recommendations.
Forge doesn't replace maintenance technicians. It makes them prophetic. They shift from emergency firefighting to strategic maintenance planning. They focus on high-value activities instead of scrambling with broken equipment.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your equipment sensor networks, maintenance management systems, and production scheduling instantly. Every plant becomes a predictive operation.
Forge turns reactive maintenance into predictive excellence. Downtime becomes predictable and preventable. Production flows smoothly. Maintenance costs decline while reliability soars.
