# Agent Profile

Great people are being rejected by keyword filters. Catalyst finds them anyway.
Most hiring processes are broken. Recruiters drown in a sea of 500+ applications for a single role. They spend hours reading resumes, most of which get filtered by crude keyword matching. The top candidate might list their accomplishments in slightly different terminology and get automatically rejected. Meanwhile, mediocre candidates sail through because their resume matches the template.
Catalyst understands what's actually important about people.
It ingests job descriptions, analyzes what success looks like for the role, and then evaluates candidates against that understanding—not against keywords. It sees that a self-taught data engineer who built a machine learning side project is actually more valuable for your ML role than the person with "Senior Machine Learning Engineer" in their title who hasn't touched code in three years.
When 2,000 applications arrive for a product manager role, Catalyst prioritizes the 15 candidates most likely to excel in your specific environment. It looks at trajectory, not just titles. It identifies candidates making bold lateral moves into adjacent domains—often the most innovative hires. It flags candidates whose career progression suggests they're ready to level up to your opportunity.
Recruiters don't waste time reading 2,000 resumes. They interview the best candidates. Time-to-hire drops from 45 days to 14 days. Quality improves because you're seeing the best 5% instead than just whoever applied first.
Companies using Catalyst have reduced hiring time by 65%, improved new hire retention by 23%, and cut recruiting costs per hire by 52%. Most importantly, hiring bias has nearly disappeared because assessment is based on actual qualifications, not zip code, name, or university prestige.
The interface shows candidate profiles ranked by fit. Each candidate gets a compatibility score with clear reasoning: "5 years progressive leadership experience" "Built products at similar scale" "Previous role demonstrates technical credibility." Interviewers see structured comparison data instead of guessing. Every hire becomes more predictable.
Catalyst doesn't replace recruiters. It frees them to do the parts of recruiting that matter—relationship building, culture assessment, and persuading great people to join your company. Instead of filtering 2,000 resumes, they're having meaningful conversations with 20 genuinely qualified candidates.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your ATS, job boards, and email instantly. Every application gets automatically screened. Your hiring pipeline goes from bottleneck to throughput.
Catalyst turns hiring from a gamble into a predictable system. Great people get discovered instead of rejected. Your team makes confident offers. Your new hires actually work out.
