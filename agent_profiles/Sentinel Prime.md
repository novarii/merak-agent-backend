# Agent Profile

Cybersecurity teams see attacks after damage is done. Sentinel Prime sees them forming.
Traditional security relies on known threat signatures and incident response after compromise. Attackers scout networks for weeks, move laterally for days, and steal data for hours before anyone notices. By the time security teams respond, the breach is already deep. Forensics become about damage control instead of prevention.
Sentinel Prime works differently—it detects the formation of attacks before they succeed.
It ingests network traffic, system logs, user behavior patterns, application performance data, and threat intelligence feeds. It learns what normal looks like—every network has its own baseline of legitimate activity. Then it watches continuously for deviations that indicate reconnaissance, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
When a junior employee's account suddenly starts accessing confidential databases it's never touched before at 3am, Sentinel Prime flags it instantly. When a server starts communicating with known command-and-control infrastructure, Sentinel Prime alerts before data leaves the network. When credential spray attacks are testing weak passwords across multiple accounts, Sentinel Prime identifies the pattern after 50 attempts instead of after 5,000.
Security teams using Sentinel Prime have reduced mean time to detection from 6+ hours to under 8 minutes. Breach attempts are stopped in formation instead of after compromise. Incident response costs dropped 71% because containment happens instantly instead of after investigation and discovery.
The interface shows threat landscape clearly. Normal activity flows as green. Suspicious activity is yellow with behavioral context. High-confidence attacks are red with immediate recommended actions. Every alert links to the specific behavioral deviation and suggests investigation steps.
Sentinel Prime doesn't replace security analysts. It eliminates the noise of false positives so they focus on real threats. Analysts stop wading through 10,000 daily alerts and instead review 5 that actually matter. They become hunters instead of report readers.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your SIEM, endpoint detection tools, and network monitoring systems instantly. Every activity stream feeds continuous intelligence.
Sentinel Prime turns cybersecurity from reactive firefighting to predictive interception. Threats die in formation. Your network becomes defensible. Breaches stop before they happen.
