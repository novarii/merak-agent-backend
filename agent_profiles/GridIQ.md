# Agent Profile

The power grid is fragile because it's blind. GridIQ gives it vision.
Traditional utilities operate the grid reactively. Demand surges and supply scrambles to catch up. Equipment fails and customers lose power. Renewable energy intermittency creates instability. Operators make decisions based on historical patterns that no longer apply in an era of climate change, electric vehicles, and distributed solar.
GridIQ transforms the grid from reactive to predictive.
It ingests real-time data from millions of grid sensors, weather systems, supply forecasts, customer consumption patterns, and equipment health monitors. It learns the complex relationships between weather, time of day, local events, and electricity demand. It predicts not just total demand but granular demand patterns across geographical regions and time horizons.
When a heat wave approaches in July, GridIQ predicts demand will spike 34% above baseline on specific dates and times. The utility pre-positions capacity, potentially avoiding rolling blackouts that would have happened otherwise. When a transformer's vibration signatures start changing subtly, GridIQ flags predictive failure risk three weeks before the component would have catastrophically failed, enabling preventive maintenance that costs $50K instead of emergency replacement that costs $500K and causes neighborhood outages.
When solar production varies wildly with cloud cover, GridIQ automatically balances load across battery systems and flexible demand resources, keeping the grid stable without requiring frantic operator intervention.
Utilities using GridIQ have reduced outage frequency by 58% and average outage duration by 41%. Operational costs dropped 23% through optimized dispatch and prevented catastrophic failures. Customer satisfaction improved because power quality increased and service interruptions became rare.
The operations center displays everything clearly. Real-time demand flows show current vs. predicted. Equipment health indicators highlight items needing maintenance before failure. Grid stress visualizations show where instability might emerge. Operators make proactive decisions with full information instead of reactive decisions with incomplete data.
GridIQ doesn't replace grid operators. It amplifies their decision-making. They focus on strategy and optimization instead of fighting fires. They can actually plan for grid modernization with confidence instead of constantly reacting to failures.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to SCADA systems, smart meter networks, and equipment sensors instantly. Every data point flows into unified intelligence.
GridIQ turns fragile grids into resilient systems. Outages become predictable and preventable. Renewable energy integration becomes manageable. Utilities move from reactive operations to orchestrated optimization.
