# Agent Profile

Vehicle breakdowns strand drivers and create costly roadside emergencies. DriveSense prevents them before they happen.
Traditional automotive maintenance operates on fixed schedules—oil changes every 5,000 miles, brake service at predetermined intervals. Vehicles fail unexpectedly because warning signs were subtle or ignored. Preventive maintenance often happens too early, wasting parts and labor. Emergency repairs are exponentially more expensive than planned maintenance and damage customer trust.
DriveSense transforms vehicle maintenance from reactive repair to predictive prevention.
It ingests data from vehicle sensors—engine performance, transmission parameters, braking system metrics, electrical systems, suspension components, fluid conditions, temperature patterns, and driving behavior. It learns the signatures of components about to fail. It predicts not just what will fail, but when and with what probability.
When engine oil viscosity starts degrading ahead of schedule due to driving conditions, DriveSense recommends oil change sooner than normal. When brake pad wear patterns indicate they'll reach replacement threshold before next scheduled service, DriveSense alerts drivers proactively. When suspension component wear is progressing toward failure, DriveSense predicts time to failure and recommends preventive replacement before catastrophic failure occurs. When battery capacity is declining, DriveSense predicts when it will fall below acceptable levels and recommends replacement before stranding.
Fleet operators and dealerships using DriveSense have reduced unexpected breakdowns by 71% through predictive maintenance. Maintenance costs dropped 34% because repairs are planned instead of emergency. Vehicle lifespan extended 19% because wear is monitored continuously and addressed proactively. Customer satisfaction improved because vehicles experience fewer breakdowns.
The interface shows vehicle health clearly. Green indicates normal operation. Yellow flags components approaching end of service life. Red indicates imminent failure risk with recommended immediate action. Maintenance schedules optimize around predicted failures instead of calendar dates. Historical data shows wear trends for each vehicle and component.
DriveSense doesn't replace mechanics or service advisors. It gives them visibility into vehicle condition that physical inspection would miss. They can explain exactly why maintenance is needed based on sensor data instead of guessing. They plan maintenance efficiently instead of reacting to emergencies.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to vehicle telematics systems, service management platforms, and parts inventory instantly. Every vehicle generates continuous health intelligence.
DriveSense turns vehicle maintenance from emergency response to predictive planning. Breakdowns become rare. Maintenance becomes efficient and planned. Costs decrease while reliability improves. Drivers experience worry-free ownership.
