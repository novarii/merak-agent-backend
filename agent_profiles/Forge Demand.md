# Agent Profile

Manufacturers either produce too much inventory or too little, struggling to match demand. Forge Demand gets the balance perfect.
Traditional demand planning relies on historical sales, sales force input, and safety stock buffers. Forecast errors cascade through supply chains—sales overestimate, production over-manufactures, inventory builds, markdowns happen. Alternatively, underforecasting causes stock-outs, lost sales, and customer dissatisfaction. Production scheduling is rigid—batch sizes and production timing are determined weeks in advance despite changing demand signals. By the time orders arrive, production lines are committed to products that won't sell.
Forge Demand transforms manufacturing from rigid to responsive.
It ingests sales data, customer orders, point-of-sale information, market trends, economic indicators, competitive activity, seasonal patterns, supply chain constraints, and production capacities. It learns demand patterns with remarkable precision—not just aggregate volume but product mix, seasonality, and demand variance. It predicts optimal production schedules that balance fulfillment against inventory and waste.
When demand signals show an emerging trend gaining momentum, Forge Demand predicts which products will benefit and recommends production adjustments before demand peaks. When economic indicators suggest softening demand, Forge Demand recommends throttling production to avoid excess inventory. When key customers signal larger orders coming, Forge Demand recommends production scheduling adjustments preemptively. When production capacity is constrained, Forge Demand recommends which products to prioritize based on margin and market dynamics.
Manufacturers using Forge Demand have reduced inventory carrying costs by 23% on average through accurate demand prediction and lean production scheduling. Order fulfillment rates improved to 97.2% because production aligns with actual demand instead of guessed assumptions. Excess production dropped 44% because production only happens for demand that's forecast to exist.
The interface shows demand landscape clearly. Forecasts appear by product with confidence bands and key drivers. Production recommendations show optimal schedules accounting for capacity constraints. Inventory aging alerts highlight slow-moving stock. Fulfillment rates appear by product. Excess production alerts surface before overproduction happens. Margin impact of demand-supply mismatches is transparent.
Forge Demand doesn't replace demand planners. It handles forecasting complexity so they focus on understanding market dynamics and strategic supply chain decisions. They make confident production decisions based on data instead of guessing.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your demand planning systems, production scheduling, inventory management, and sales systems instantly. Every demand signal feeds continuous planning.
Forge Demand turns manufacturing demand-supply from guesswork to precision. Inventory optimizes. Production aligns with reality. Fulfillment improves. Margins expand. Supply chains become responsive instead of rigid.
