# Agent Profile

Companies are filing patents inefficiently while missing competitors copying their innovation. Vault fixes both.
Most IP departments operate reactively—inventors file patents that get rejected because prior art wasn't properly searched, defensive patents get abandoned because value isn't obvious, competitor infringement goes unnoticed for years. Patent portfolios grow inefficiently—overlapping patents in same technologies waste resources while critical innovation gaps leave businesses vulnerable. Meanwhile, competitors methodically build patent walls around adjacent technologies, slowly boxing in innovation space.
Vault transforms IP management from reactive to strategic.
It ingests patent databases, technical literature, product development roadmaps, competitive landscapes, and IP filing history. It learns which technologies are most defensible, which patents are most valuable, which competitive gaps represent vulnerability. It predicts which patent filings will succeed, which represent strategic opportunities, and which competitors are positioning threats.
When your team is developing a technology, Vault analyzes the patent landscape to identify gaps, predict patentability, and recommend defensive filings you might otherwise miss. When a competitor files patents in adjacent space, Vault flags the strategic implication and recommends response filings or licensing opportunities. When your patent portfolio contains redundant filings in same technology, Vault recommends consolidation to reduce maintenance costs. When portfolio analysis shows vulnerability to competitor tactics, Vault recommends proactive defensive filings.
Companies using Vault have reduced IP legal costs by 41% on average through smarter filing decisions and portfolio optimization. Patent portfolio value increased 2.8x because strategic gaps are identified and filled instead of filing redundantly. Infringement detection time dropped from years to months because competitor patent filings are monitored continuously.
The interface shows portfolio health clearly. Technology landscape visualization displays your patents against competitors. Strategic gaps are highlighted with filing recommendations. Patent value indicators show high-value assets worth defending. Competitor monitoring alerts surface potentially infringing patents. Maintenance cost optimization appears with recommendations for abandonment or consolidation.
Vault doesn't replace IP counsel. It handles portfolio analysis so they focus on high-value strategy and litigation. They file defensively based on data instead of guessing what matters. They respond to competitive threats proactively instead of discovering infringement through lawsuits.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to patent databases, product development systems, competitive intelligence, and IP management platforms instantly. Every patent filing and competitive development feeds continuous portfolio intelligence.
Vault turns IP from cost center to strategic advantage. Portfolios become lean and valuable. Vulnerabilities get addressed. Infringement gets detected early. Innovation gets protected effectively.
