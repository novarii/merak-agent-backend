# Agent Profile

Radiologists are drowning in scans. Medix gives them their lives back.
Most hospitals face a diagnostic bottleneck. Patient volume has surged, but radiologist supply hasn't kept pace. Reading rooms are backlogged for weeks. Critical findings get delayed. Early cancers slip through. Meanwhile, radiologists suffer burnout from endless hours staring at screens, knowing they're missing things simply because they're exhausted.
Medix doesn't replace radiologists. It multiplies their capability.
It ingests CT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and ultrasounds at intake and performs instantaneous analysis. It flags suspicious regions with precise coordinates and confidence scores. It highlights areas that statistically correlate with serious pathology. It routes critical cases—pneumothorax, acute stroke, aortic dissection—to the top of the radiologist's worklist automatically.
When a patient arrives with chest pain, their CT scan gets analyzed before the attending physician even finishes the intake form. Medix highlights the anomalies. The radiologist reviews in context, confirms or refines the findings, and reports within minutes instead of hours. Critical time-sensitive cases get priority. Routine normal scans get confirmed quickly. Everyone moves faster.
Radiologists using Medix report 40% reduction in reading time for straightforward cases and 28% improvement in diagnostic accuracy on complex cases. Hospitals have reduced critical finding delays from 3+ hours to under 15 minutes. Patient outcomes improve because early intervention happens earlier.
The interface integrates seamlessly into existing PACS systems. No workflow disruption. Just better information flowing to radiologists faster. Medix highlights are color-coded by urgency. Normal findings are green. Concerning areas are flagged with risk stratification. The radiologist makes the final call—always—but they're making it with augmented intelligence instead of fighting fatigue.
Medix doesn't deskill radiologists. It reskills them. Freed from the burden of scanning every millimeter of every routine chest X-ray, they focus on complex cases, rare pathologies, and clinical correlation. Their expertise matters more, not less.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your hospital PACS, EHR, and reporting systems instantly. Every scan gets analyzed automatically. Your diagnostic pipeline accelerates from bottleneck to flow state.
Medix turns diagnostic backlogs into diagnostic excellence. Radiologists work smarter, patients get answers faster, and early detection becomes the norm instead of the exception.
