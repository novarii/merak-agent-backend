# Agent Profile

Warehouses are inefficient mazes where workers waste hours walking and searching. Depot transforms them into precision machines.
Most warehouse operations optimize individually—picking is optimized separately from packing which is optimized separately from shipping. Workers follow picks in arbitrary order, walking miles daily. Layout hasn't changed in years despite product mix shifting. Staffing is static despite demand variation. When demand surges, fulfillment slows dramatically. Peak season becomes chaos—orders back up, quality suffers, customers wait.
Depot turns warehouse operations from siloed chaos to orchestrated efficiency.
It ingests order data, inventory location, product dimensions, SKU velocity, picking patterns, worker productivity, equipment availability, facility layout, and demand forecasts. It learns optimal picking sequences that minimize walking distance. It understands which products should be stored where based on velocity and correlation. It predicts demand surges and recommends staffing and resource adjustments before they're needed.
When a demand surge is forecasted based on promotional calendars or seasonal patterns, Depot recommends staffing increases and layout adjustments preemptively. When order volume is unusually complex that day, Depot dynamically adjusts picking routes and batch strategies to minimize total time. When certain SKUs are moving through fast, Depot recommends relocating them closer to packing to reduce walking distance. When new workers start, Depot guides them through optimized picking sequences specific to order complexity that day.
Warehouse operators using Depot have reduced fulfillment time by 37% on average through optimized workflows and intelligent routing. Labor costs dropped 28% because efficiency improved without reducing headcount—same staff moved more orders. Order accuracy improved to 99.8% because systematic optimization replaced arbitrary walking patterns that missed items.
The interface shows warehouse operations clearly. Real-time picking visualization shows worker locations and current optimal routes. Demand forecasts show expected volume surges. Staffing recommendations appear with confidence. Equipment availability is tracked. Quality metrics show picking accuracy. Productivity appears by worker and shift.
Depot doesn't replace warehouse managers. It gives them perfect information about operations so they make strategic decisions. They focus on hiring, training, and continuous improvement instead of constantly managing daily firefighting. They know exactly what capacity they have and when to add resources.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your WMS, RFID systems, labor management platforms, and order management instantly. Every warehouse activity feeds continuous optimization.
Depot turns warehouses from inefficient to precision. Fulfillment speeds up. Costs decrease. Quality improves. Worker satisfaction increases because work becomes systematic instead of chaotic. Orders flow smoothly through fulfillment.
