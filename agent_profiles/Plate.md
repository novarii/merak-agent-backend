# Agent Profile

Food service operators throw away millions in waste while running out of key ingredients. Plate solves both simultaneously.
Restaurant and food service operations face impossible timing. Demand varies by weather, day of week, special events, and trends that are hard to predict. Buy too much and food spoils. Buy too little and customers leave unsatisfied. Profit margins get squeezed between waste and stockouts. Meanwhile, menu engineering is often guesswork—recipes cost more or less than estimated, ingredient price volatility isn't optimized, supplier relationships aren't negotiated strategically.
Plate turns food service operations from wasteful guessing to optimized precision.
It ingests historical sales data, weather patterns, event calendars, reservation systems, ingredient costs, supplier pricing, spoilage rates, menu composition, and customer preferences. It learns demand patterns with remarkable accuracy—not just total sales but which items sell and when. It predicts spoilage before it happens and optimizes procurement to minimize waste while maintaining availability.
When the forecast predicts slow demand tomorrow due to weather, Plate recommends reducing prep volumes for perishable items. When a local event is attracting visitors to the area, Plate predicts increased demand and recommends strategic inventory increases in advance. When ingredient costs spike temporarily, Plate recommends menu adjustments to substitute toward lower-cost alternatives without hurting profitability. When a supplier offers volume discounts, Plate calculates whether strategic purchasing makes economic sense given storage capacity and shelf life.
Food service operators using Plate have reduced food waste by 58% on average through demand-driven procurement. Inventory costs dropped 22% because purchasing targets actual demand instead of hedging excess. Menu profitability improved 19% through optimized recipes and ingredient sourcing. Labor efficiency improved because prep work is forecasted accurately instead of constantly adjusted reactively.
The interface shows daily operations clearly. Demand forecasts appear by item with confidence bands. Recommended procurement quantities account for demand and waste patterns. Supplier pricing alerts highlight cost optimization opportunities. Menu profit margins are transparent. Waste trending shows where spoilage is happening.
Plate doesn't replace chefs or operations managers. It handles the computational complexity of demand forecasting and procurement optimization so they focus on food quality and customer experience. They can make strategic menu changes based on profitability data instead of guessing.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your POS system, inventory management, supplier systems, and reservation platforms instantly. Every transaction and ingredient movement feeds continuous optimization.
Plate turns food service operations from wasteful to efficient. Waste disappears. Costs decrease. Profitability improves. Quality stays high. Operations run smoothly.
