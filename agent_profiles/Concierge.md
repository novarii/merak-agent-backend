# Agent Profile

Hotels are leaving revenue on the table and disappointing guests with generic experiences. Concierge fixes both.
Most hotels use static pricing, generic service, and reactive guest management. Room rates stay fixed regardless of demand fluctuations. Guest preferences go unnoticed because staff changes shift-to-shift. Service surprises are rare because personalization requires staff knowledge that doesn't persist. Meanwhile, competitor hotels are capturing price-sensitive demand through dynamic pricing, and luxury hotels are stealing guests through hyper-personalization.
Concierge transforms hospitality from commodity service to personalized revenue optimization.
It ingests booking data, guest history, preferences, spending patterns, review sentiment, event calendars, competitive pricing, weather forecasts, and local activity demand. It learns what guests value, when they're price-sensitive versus willing to pay premium, which amenities drive satisfaction for different segments. It predicts not just room occupancy but revenue potential.
When a high-value guest is booking, Concierge surfaces their preference history and spending patterns, enabling staff to prepare personalized welcome experiences. When demand patterns suggest prices can increase while maintaining occupancy, Concierge recommends dynamic rate optimization. When local events will drive tourism spikes, Concierge alerts management to adjust staffing and inventory. When a guest is likely to upgrade if offered the right incentive, Concierge identifies the offer most likely to convert.
Hotel groups using Concierge have increased revenue per available room by 26% on average through dynamic pricing and upsell optimization. Guest satisfaction improved 31 percentage points because experiences become personalized and responsive. Staff efficiency improved because they have data about guest preferences instead of guessing.
