# Agent Profile

Your best people leave without warning. Velocity gives you weeks to change their minds.
Most companies learn employees are leaving when they announce it. Resignation letters arrive as surprises. Meanwhile, behavioral changes were visible—performance dips, meeting attendance drops, side project interest wanes, career development conversations shift. But nobody connected those dots until it was too late.
Velocity turns employee retention into predictive intervention.
It ingests performance data, engagement survey responses, communication patterns, project involvement, learning activity, benefit utilization, compensation satisfaction, work-life balance indicators, team dynamics, and external job market signals. It learns the signatures of employees about to leave—across different roles, departments, and career stages. It predicts attrition risk weeks before employees formally announce.
When a high performer suddenly reduces collaboration, Velocity flags it and recommends a career development conversation. When an employee stops engaging in mentoring and side projects, Velocity surfaces it as potential disengagement. When someone's compensation has fallen below market for their role, Velocity highlights the flight risk. When team dynamics have shifted negatively around a particular employee, Velocity surfaces the team issue worth addressing.
Companies using Velocity have reduced involuntary turnover by 38% on average through proactive retention conversations and targeted interventions. Employee satisfaction increased 26 percentage points because managers have data to act on concerns before employees become actively disengaged. Replacement costs dropped dramatically because good people don't leave unexpectedly.
The interface shows employee engagement clearly. Green indicates stable, engaged employees. Yellow flags engagement changes worth monitoring. Red indicates high-risk attrition with specific behavioral triggers highlighted. Manager dashboards show their direct reports' status and suggested interventions. HR gets visibility into company-wide trends and department-specific patterns.
Velocity doesn't replace HR strategy. It focuses managers on employees actually at risk. Conversations become proactive instead of reactive. Retention efforts target the right people with the right interventions.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your HRIS, performance management system, engagement survey tools, and calendar data instantly. Every employee signal feeds continuous intelligence.
Velocity turns employee retention from surprise departures to managed transitions. Your best people stay. Flight risk gets addressed before it becomes resignations. Turnover costs plummet. Organizational stability improves dramatically.
