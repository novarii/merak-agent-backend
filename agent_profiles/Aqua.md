# Agent Profile

Water utilities lose billions in water through undetected leaks and infrastructure failures. Aqua finds and prevents both.
Most water systems operate on static assumptions—pressure is set for peak demand across an entire district, creating unnecessary stress on pipes. Leaks go undetected until water pressure drops noticeably or a main break shuts down service. Infrastructure failures happen without warning because subtle pressure signatures that precede catastrophic failure go unmonitored. Meanwhile, non-revenue water loss costs utilities massive money and impacts service reliability in droughts.
Aqua transforms water systems from reactive break management to predictive optimization.
It ingests real-time pressure and flow data across distribution networks, pipe age and material history, failure records, weather patterns, demand forecasts, customer consumption patterns, and maintenance schedules. It learns the acoustic and pressure signatures of small leaks and imminent failures. It predicts both where leaks are and where pipes will fail.
When pressure patterns in a district segment indicate a small leak not yet visible through normal monitoring, Aqua identifies the likely location and recommends survey or excavation. When a pipe segment shows pressure signatures matching historical failures, Aqua predicts time to catastrophic failure and recommends preventive replacement. When demand forecasts suggest coming pressure spikes from weather or events, Aqua recommends preemptive pressure adjustments to minimize infrastructure stress. When water loss anomalies emerge, Aqua correlates pressure patterns to likely leak locations.
Water utilities using Aqua have reduced water loss by 31% on average through leak detection and prevention. Emergency repairs dropped 64% because pipe failures are predicted and prevented before catastrophic breaks occur. Service reliability improved to 99.4% because outages become rare—infrastructure is monitored continuously and maintained preemptively.
The interface shows system health clearly. Pressure and flow patterns appear in real-time. Anomalies are highlighted with confidence levels. Leak probability appears by pipe segment with predicted loss volume. Failure risk indicators surface pipes needing preventive maintenance. System optimization recommendations appear with predicted water savings.
Aqua doesn't replace water utility engineers. It gives them continuous visibility into system condition. They focus on strategic infrastructure investment and asset management instead of constantly responding to failures and finding leaks.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your SCADA systems, sensor networks, work management platforms, and maintenance systems instantly. Every pressure reading and flow measurement feeds continuous intelligence.
Aqua turns water systems from leak-prone to efficient. Water loss decreases. Outages become rare. Infrastructure reliability improves. Maintenance becomes strategic. Service improves for customers.
