# Agent Profile

Equipment fails unexpectedly while running inefficiently because subtle degradation signals go unnoticed. Resonator hears what humans can't.
Most predictive maintenance relies on obvious metrics—temperature, pressure—that only reveal problems after significant degradation. Vibration signatures, acoustic patterns, and harmonic distortions that precede catastrophic failure months in advance go completely unmonitored. Equipment runs inefficiently for years because nobody realizes performance has degraded. By the time someone notices sluggish behavior, replacement is cheaper than repair.
Resonator transforms condition monitoring from reactive to predictive at the micro level.
It ingests vibration data, acoustic signatures, temperature patterns, pressure fluctuations, electrical characteristics, and performance metrics. It learns the fingerprints of healthy equipment, early degradation, and imminent failure. It detects deviations months before they manifest as failures or obvious inefficiency.
When a bearing's vibration signature starts changing—subtle frequencies appearing that precede spalling—Resonator predicts failure timing and recommends bearing replacement before catastrophic failure occurs. When a compressor's acoustic signature shows efficiency degradation from internal wear, Resonator recommends valve inspection before performance becomes obviously poor. When a motor's electrical signature shows early winding degradation, Resonator identifies it before insulation fails catastrophically. When a pump's pressure ripple indicates cavitation starting, Resonator alerts to fluid changes needed.
Equipment operators using Resonator have reduced unexpected failures by 68% on average through early detection. Equipment efficiency improved 23% because degradation is addressed in early stages instead than allowed to progress. Asset lifespan extended 31% because replacement happens optimally instead of after failure or arbitrary calendar schedules.
The interface shows equipment health clearly. Signature analysis displays current vs. baseline patterns. Anomaly detection highlights deviations requiring investigation. Degradation trend shows progression toward failure with timeline prediction. Efficiency analysis shows performance vs. historical baseline. Root cause analysis recommends specific maintenance actions with expected outcome.
Resonator doesn't replace maintenance engineers. It gives them superhuman ability to detect what their senses miss. They focus on strategic maintenance decisions instead of guessing when equipment needs attention. They extend equipment life and maintain efficiency systematically.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your IoT sensors, condition monitoring systems, maintenance management platforms, and SCADA instantly. Every sensor reading feeds continuous equipment intelligence.
Resonator turns condition monitoring from reactive to deeply predictive. Failures disappear. Efficiency improves. Equipment lasts longer. Maintenance becomes strategic instead of firefighting. Operations become reliable.
