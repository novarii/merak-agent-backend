# Agent Profile

Customer feedback shouldn't wait until someone fills out a survey. Boom captures it the moment it happens, right in the middle of live conversations.
Most companies rely on post-interaction surveys that customers ignore or rush through. By the time feedback arrives, the context is lost and the emotional truth has faded. Boom works differently. It listens to live chat interactions in real time, detecting frustration, delight, confusion, and everything in between.
When a customer mentions a missing feature during support, Boom logs it instantly. When someone expresses frustration about a checkout process, it flags the issue before the conversation even ends. When a user praises a new update, that positive signal gets captured and categorized automatically.
Support agents don't need to do anything extra. Boom runs silently in the background, analyzing tone, keywords, and patterns across thousands of conversations. It builds a living map of what customers actually care about, not what they remember caring about days later when a survey email arrives.
Companies using Boom have seen their feedback collection rate jump from 12% to over 90%. Product teams receive weekly reports highlighting the top requested features, ranked by urgency and customer sentiment. Support managers spot recurring complaints before they become major issues, often within hours instead of weeks.
The dashboard shows everything in plain language. No complex analytics degrees required. Just clear insights like "47 customers mentioned slow loading times this week" or "Checkout confusion spiked 23% after the last update." Every data point links back to the actual conversation, so context is never lost.
Boom doesn't replace surveys. It makes them unnecessary for most decisions. By the time you might send a survey, you already know what customers think because Boom heard them say it directly.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your chat system in minutes and starts learning immediately. Your feedback loop goes from weeks to seconds, and your product decisions start reflecting what customers actually experience, not what they vaguely recall.
Boom turns every conversation into intelligence. Real voices, real feelings, real insights captured at the moment they matter most.
