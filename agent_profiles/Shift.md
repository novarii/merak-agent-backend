# Agent Profile

Companies are over-staffing with inefficient schedules while workers suffer scheduling unpredictability. Shift solves both.
Most workforce scheduling is manualâ€”managers create schedules using spreadsheets, intuition, and seniority preferences. Demand predictions are inaccurate. Staffing levels don't match workload. Overtime happens because scheduling wasn't optimized. Schedule changes are disruptive because they're last-minute. Workers have unpredictable hours making personal planning impossible. Meanwhile, labor costs are bloated because inefficient scheduling requires more staff than necessary.
Shift transforms scheduling from manual to algorithmic optimization.
It ingests demand forecasts, worker availability, skill requirements, labor regulations, labor cost preferences, worker scheduling preferences, and historical schedule performance. It learns optimal scheduling patterns that balance coverage with cost. It predicts scheduling needs and recommends staffing levels dynamically.
When demand is forecasted to spike, Shift recommends which workers to schedule, accounting for their availability and preferences. When regulations limit consecutive hours worked, Shift structures schedules to maximize compliance while maintaining coverage. When overtime is expensive, Shift recommends schedule adjustments that eliminate it while maintaining service levels. When workers prefer consistent schedules, Shift builds predictable patterns that improve satisfaction while maintaining flexibility.
Organizations using Shift have reduced labor costs by 17% on average through optimized scheduling. Schedule compliance improved 34% because workers follow schedules that were created with their input. Employee satisfaction increased 29% because schedules became predictable and considerate of preferences. Overtime decreased because optimal scheduling prevents the need for it.
The interface shows scheduling optimization clearly. Demand forecasts appear by location and time. Recommended staffing levels appear with coverage analysis. Schedule generation accounts for regulations and preferences. Cost impact shows labor savings. Worker satisfaction indicators appear. Schedule adherence metrics show whether optimization translates to practice.
Shift doesn't replace scheduling managers. It handles optimization complexity so they focus on exception handling and strategic staffing decisions. They see clearly how to staff optimally instead of guessing. They build schedules that workers respect because schedules respect worker preferences.
Integrated through Merak's Unified API, it connects to your demand forecasting, workforce management systems, time tracking, and labor regulations databases instantly. Every staffing decision and demand signal feeds continuous scheduling intelligence.
Shift turns workforce scheduling from manual chaos to algorithmic optimization. Costs decrease. Coverage improves. Compliance improves. Worker satisfaction increases. Labor becomes strategic instead of reactive.
